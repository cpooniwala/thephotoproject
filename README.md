Problem
Digital is no longer the centerpiece of brand experience. Emphasis is shifting onto how best to use it as an invisible enabler of physical and sensory experiences. We need to create new services that are deeply integrated in the physical world.

The Photo Project
The idea is simple:
Buy a disposable camera
Take 3 photos
Hand the camera to a stranger or friend
Repeat steps 2-3
Mail the camera back to us
We’ll develop the photos and you can use our platform to track the story of each camera

Research
Here are some examples of physical and digital intertwining:

Fast Co. Writes about a new smart paint that talks to canes, helping people who are sight impaired navigate

Line-Us is an internet connected robot drawing arm. It’s small, portable and draws with a nice wobbly line using real pen on paper
