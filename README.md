Digital is no longer the centerpiece of brand experience. Emphasis is shifting onto how best to use it as an invisible enabler of physical and sensory experiences. We need to create new services that are deeply integrated in the physical world.

The idea is simple:
Buy a disposable camera
Take 3 photos
Hand the camera to a stranger or friend
Repeat steps 2-3
Mail the camera back to us
Weâ€™ll develop the photos and you can use our platform to track the story of each camera
